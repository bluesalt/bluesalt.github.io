<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a> is a high performance embedded key value storage engine which is written in C++. Though its name tells that it is a database, it is actually a C++ library providing a bunch of API instead of a Client-Server architected database.</p>

<p>I am not a C++ programmer and when trying to play with RocksDB following the <a href="http://rocksdb.org/docs/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> guide from the RocksDB website, I found it is not easy to run the example in CentOS 7 with either dynamic or static linkage. To be more specific with dynamic linkage, the search paths of dynamic libraries vary from Linux distributions but the installation script of RocksDB does not take care of that.</p>

<p>This post is intended for those who want to play with RocksDB but failed to run the example. What will be mentioned including</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to install RocksDB as dynamic library from source in CentOS 7</li>
  <li>How to install RocksDB as static library in CentOS 7</li>
  <li>How to run the example program</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>Here is the demo program</p>

<p>```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "rocksdb/db.h"</iostream></p>

<p>using namespace std;</p>

<p>int main() {
    rocksdb::DB* db;
    rocksdb::Options options;
    options.create_if_missing = true;
    rocksdb::Status status = rocksdb::DB::Open(options, “/tmp/kv”, &amp;db);</p>

<pre><code>delete db;

return 0; } ```
</code></pre>

<p>Before you continue, please install the dependencies.</p>

<p><code>
sudo yum install gflags-devel snappy-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel  gcc-c++  libstdc++-devel -y
</code></p>

<h3 id="dynamic-linkage">Dynamic Linkage</h3>

<h4 id="install-the-shared-lib">Install the shared lib</h4>

<p>First, run the command line to build dynamic library </p>

<p><code>
DEBUG_LEVEL=0 make shared_lib
</code></p>

<p>The <code>Makefile</code> provides a target called <code>install-shared</code> to install RocksDB shared lib.</p>

<p><code>
DEBUG_LEVEL=0 sudo -E make install-shared
</code></p>

<p>The target actually includes two jobs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy all the header files under <code>$SRC_ROOT/include/rocksdb</code> to <code>/usr/local/include/rocksdb</code></li>
  <li>Copy the <code>.so</code> file and symbolic links to <code>/usr/local/lib</code>  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="run-the-example">Run the example</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Compile the program with following command</li>
</ul>

<p><code>bash
g++ -o demo -std=c++11 -lrocksdb demo.cpp 
</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Run the program with <code>./demo</code> and an error occurs</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
./demo: error while loading shared libraries: librocksdb.so.4.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</code></p>

<p>The problem with the <code>install-shared</code> target is that  <code>/usr/local/lib</code> is in <code>g++</code>’s dynamic library search paths but not in <code>ldconfig</code>’s in CentOS 7 by default. So the program can be built during compiling time but will cause dynamic library load error during run time. This can be verified by following commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show search paths of g++</li>
</ul>

<p><code>bash
ld --verbose | grep SEARCH_DIR | tr -s ' ;' \\012
</code> </p>

<ul>
  <li>Show search paths of ldconfig</li>
</ul>

<p><code>bash
ldconfig -v 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -v ^$'\t'
</code></p>

<p>There are 2 ways to resolve the issue. And <em>EITHER</em> one is ok.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing <code>.so</code> file and symbolic links into both the search paths of <code>g++</code> and <code>ldconfig</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>
INSTALL_PATH=/usr sudo -E make install-shared
sudo ldconfig -v  #refresh the ldconfig cache
</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Add <code>/usr/local/lib</code> to the <code>ldconfig</code>’s search paths.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
echo "/usr/local/lib" |sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/rocksdb-x86_64.conf
sudo ldconfig -v  #refresh the ldconfig cache
</code></p>

<h3 id="static-linkage">Static Linkage</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, <code>/usr/local/lib</code> is in g++’s search path, thus there is no such dynamic load issue with static RocksDB. First build and install static RocksDB.</p>

<p><code>
DEBUG_LEVEL=0 make static_lib
DEBUG_LEVEL=0 sudo -E make install-static
</code></p>

<p>Then compile the demo program with </p>

<p><code>
g++  demo.cc -o demo -lpthread -lrocksdb  -std=c++11  -lsnappy  -lz -lbz2
</code></p>

<p>or simply</p>

<p><code>
g++  demo.cc -o demo -lpthread -lrocksdb  -std=c++11
</code></p>

<p>Don’t miss the <code>pthread</code> lib.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The problem is caused by shared library search paths which could vary from different Linux distributions. A good solution to avoid the issue is packaging the files into a rpm package, and deb package in Debian platform of course.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that <code>/usr/lib64</code>, instead of <code>/usr/lib</code>, is the common place to hold the lib files in x86_64 RedHat family OSes such as CentOS, Fedora. Though <code>/usr/lib</code> works but <code>/usr/lib64</code> is a better place for the lib files in RedHat family. There is a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/2221">patch</a> to take care of that when creating a RPM.  </p>

<s>There is another problem I have not figured out yet. It is about static linkage. If anyone know how to link RocksDB program statically please drop me a note.</s>

<p>During the past years, I have been involved in several storage related projects from which I have learned a lot about the world of storage. Definitely the journey is interesting. However, it is not awesome because almost all the work I have been involved is about applications of storage. Then I decided to dig more deeper in the storage world. It turned out that it is really wonderful to explore in the world of storage. </p>

<p>Actually I have heard about FUSE before but did not spend time to explore it because I thought FUSE would bring a lot of overhead and hence won’t get too much application in system design. During the past months, I have seen the implementations of a few storage solutions, both open source and commercial ones. To my surprise, FUSE is used in those solutions. It is time to get acquainted with it. Per my experience, debugging is the very very useful way to learn a new technology. In this post, I will show how to use GDB to debug the hello example. You can set break points, use single step execution to observe the behavior of the FUSE application. 
<!--more-->
<strong>CLAIM</strong>: I am not an expert on GDB or FUSE and I can’t guarantee that it is practical in debugging your real world solution.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-fuse">Introduction to FUSE</h2>
<p>From the OS course in undergraduate school, your are told that file system is part of the kernel and it is almost true in the real world. That means typically if you want to create your own file system in a real world OS such as Linux, you have to program at the <strong>kernel space</strong>. However you can create your own file system totally in <strong>user space</strong> with the help of FUSE: Filesystem in Userspace. What is the difference? Well, there is much more restriction in kernel space programming than user space. For example, no call to third parties library such as glibc, limited recursive depth. Since Linux kernel is monolithic, a crashed kernel space program(kernel module) could make the whole OS crash too.</p>

<p>There is a simple hello file system from the homepage of the FUSE project.
Use following command lines to test the hello file system. I tested it in a Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 box.

<code>
gcc -Wall hello.c `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` -o hello
mkdir /tmp/fuse
./hello /tmp/fuse
</code> 
</p>

<p>If every thing is all right, you should see following result:

<code>
jeff@trusty:~$ ls -l /tmp/fuse
total 0
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 13 Jan  1  1970 hello
jeff@trusty:~$ cat /tmp/fuse/hello
Hello World!
</code>

## How does FUSE work
<span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/fuse.png' width='' height='' alt='Fig-1: Workflow of FUSE' title='Fig-1: Workflow of FUSE'><span class='caption-text'>Fig-1: Workflow of FUSE</span></span></p>

<p>Fig-1 is the workflow of FUSE fetched from the homepage of the FUSE project. The remaining in this section will try to explain the process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Just like EXT4, EXT3, the hello file system much be mounted before it can be used. The command <code>./hello /tmp/fuse</code> will mount it. It should be noted that this <code>hello</code> command will not only mount the hello FS, but also <strong>running as a daemon</strong> in the background. This is very important to understand the whole work process. Now you can verify whether the fs is mounted or not by issuing <code>mount</code> in the command line. </li>
  <li>Users  issue the command <code>ls -l /tmp/fuse</code> </li>
  <li>The <code>ls</code> program will call functions lived in glibc </li>
  <li>The glibc fucntions called in step 2 will send the requests to the kernel’s VFS subsystem with sys calls. </li>
  <li>The VFS sub system will call FUSE module lived in the kernel like it does when dealing with other file systems such as NFS, EXT4. Util now, the workflow is the same with any other FS.</li>
  <li>Unlike other FSes, the FUSE module in kernel will now call the the hello daemon created in Step 1.</li>
  <li>The hello daemon then sends the result back to the FUSE kernel module</li>
  <li>The rest work is the same with other FSes. The result will be passed in the path: FUSE kernel module -&gt; VFS -&gt; glibc -&gt; ls command</li>
</ol>

<p>With the explanation above, you should understand the overall process. So the FUSE is actually a framework which lives in the kernel space like other file systems. A FUSE file system must be built under that framework.</p>

<p>Next let’s look more deeper. The GDB will be leveraged to track the detail of function calls in next section. BTW, I have not figured out how the FUSE kernel module communicates with the hello daemon living in the user space yet.</p>

<h2 id="use-gdb-with-fuse">Use GDB with FUSE</h2>
<p>Since the hello daemon runs in the user space, we can attach it to the GDB like other user space applications. But before that we should make some extra preparations.

<code>bash
gcc -Wall -g hello.c `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` -o hello # Compile with debug symbols flag
./hello /tmp/fuse -s # Run the daemon in single thread mode
ps -ef | grep hello # Search the pid of the hello daemon
</code>
</p>

<p>Now it is ready to enter the gdb by issue <code>gdb64</code> in the command line. Attach the process to the gdb by <code>attach PID_OF_THE_HELLO_DAMONE</code>. Since we want to track which functions are called when the command <code>ls -l /tmp/fuse</code> is issued, we should set breakpoints for the 4 functions, namely <code>hello_open, hello_getattr, hello_readdir, hello_read</code> with following gdb commands.</p>

<p><code>
(gdb) break hello_getattr
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40076d: file hello.c, line 24.
(gdb) break hello_readdir
Breakpoint 2 at 0x40082d: file hello.c, line 46.
(gdb) break hello_open
Breakpoint 3 at 0x4008b1: file hello.c, line 58.
(gdb) break hello_read
Breakpoint 4 at 0x400909: file hello.c, line 72.
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
</code>
Now the gdb should be in listen on the daemon. When a break point is hit, it will stop the daemon process immediately. Let’s open a new shell windows and issue the command <code>ls -l /tmp/fuse</code>. <strong>DO NOT use tab-complete feature when entering the command</strong>. Or the behavior it will be a little confusing though it could be still reasoning. Let’s check the first break point.</p>

<p>```
(gdb) continue
Continuing.</p>

<p>Breakpoint 1, hello_getattr (path=0x6d5100 “/”, stbuf=0x7fff92c71080) at hello.c:24
24		int res = 0;
```
From the output, we can see that the command will first get the attributes of the  hello file system’s root director, namely <code>/tmp/fuse</code> mount point. Enter <code>continue</code> to resume the daemon process.</p>

<p>```
Breakpoint 2, hello_readdir (path=0x6f5940 “/”, buf=0x6d5100, filler=0x7f27f8e8e220, offset=0, fi=0x7fff92c710e0) at hello.c:46
46		if (strcmp(path, “/”) != 0)
(gdb) continue
Continuing.</p>

<p>Breakpoint 1, hello_getattr (path=0x6f5940 “/hello”, stbuf=0x7fff92c710b0) at hello.c:24
24		int res = 0;
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
```
When can see all the rest function calls for the <code>ls</code> command from the above output which is quite self-explanatory. You can also use similar way to track the function calls when the command <code>cat /tmp/fuse/hello</code> is issued. </p>

<p>Hope this posts helps you understand how FUSE works!</p>

<h2 id="trouble-shooting">Trouble Shooting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fail to attach the daemon process in GDB. The error looks like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
(gdb) attach 13387
Attaching to process 13387
"/home/jeff/workspace/fuse/hello": not in executable format: File format not recognized
</code>
This is because the hello executable file is a 64 bit binary but the gdb is 32 bit. Use the 64-bit GDB <code>gdb64</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fail to link the executable file with error:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
/tmp/ccIMWTZv.o: In function `main':
hello.c:(.text+0x268): undefined reference to `fuse_main_real'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status 
</code>
This is a silly problem. Make sure you use the the correct command
 
<code>
gcc -Wall hello.c `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` -o hello # work
gcc -Wall `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs` hello.c -o hello # can't work
</code>
