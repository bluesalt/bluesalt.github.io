<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Include mechanism is one of my favorite features about Ansible because it is the key to adhere to the principle of DRY that stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself which is of great importance to write reusable and maintainable Ansible code.</p>

<p>This post won’t cover every piece of the include feature. Please go through the docs from Ansible docs site before continuing if you are not familiar with Ansible include. <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html">link 1</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/include_module.html">link 2</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>There are 2 kinds of includes, namely dynamic and static. Essentially, at the moment. Any include in Ansible is a form of tasks expanding. When a file A includes file B, tasks defined in B will be added to file A. The difference between the two is that included tasks will be expanded during parsing time in static include while in the other case tasks will be expanded when playbooks are running.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/rhops/ansible-static-include-demo">repo</a> in GitHub intended for demonstration and readers are supposed to be familiar with that. The idea comes from OpenStack’s  release convention through which each major release will have a numeric version and a associated code name such as <code>kilo</code> and <code>ocata</code>. The convention is similar to Ubuntu’s. Assume that the OpenStack infrastructure is managed by Ansible and sometimes the gap between different major release is so huge that you have to create dedicated tasks for each major release.</p>

<h3 id="awesomeness-of-include">Awesomeness of Include</h3>
<p>We know that include could be applied to tasks, plays and handlers. We also know that include could be dynamic or static. So far there are 2 features exciting me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Filename variable substitution</li>
  <li>Include with complex controls such as for loop which is impossible without dynamic include</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes them awesome is that they result in more clean Ansible code and thus more maintainable. Instead of being shipped when Ansible was born, they were added through the evolution of Ansible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Filename variable substitution has been added since 1.7</li>
  <li>Dynamic include was introduced for the first time in 2.0</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="filename-variable-substitution">Filename Variable Substitution</h3>
<p>In the old days, variables in names of included files were not allowed. Take the demo repo as an example, anyone who wants to switch tasks based on the codename, he will have to write follow Ansible code.</p>

<h2 id="yaml">```yaml</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>include: ocata.yml
when: codename == ‘ocata’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include: kilo.yml
when: codename == ‘kilo’
```</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not bad so far since there are only 2 codenames. But what if you have 10 codenames? This definitely violates the DRY principle. With filename variable substitution, the code could become much more clean.</p>

<p>
<code>yaml
---
- include: "{{ codename }}.yml"
</code>
</p>

<p>Now every one is happy with filename variable substitution because there is much less code to maintain. And as we know, there are multiple places to define variable in Ansible such as inventory vars, playbooks’ <code>vars</code> or <code>vars_files</code> sections, roles’ <code>defaults</code> or  <code>vars</code> directories, command lines’ <code>--extra-vars</code> parameters and so on. Are the variables used in filename allowed to be defined anywhere? The short answer is <em>NO</em> to static include and <em>YES</em> to dynamic include. More detail will be provided in following sections, just keep in mind that <strong>variable substitution is applied to both static and dynamic include</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="static-include">Static Include</h3>
<p>Refer to the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_roles.html#dynamic-versus-static-includes">doc</a> to check how to identify a static include. You should learn when an include will be considered as static.</p>

<h4 id="variable-substitution">Variable Substitution</h4>
<p>As mentioned before, static include is parsed during compile time at which some variables such as those defined as inventory ones are not available, thus in static includes, variables used in names are not allowed to be defined in the places other than the following <em>3</em> places.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Extra vars in the command line. <a href="https://github.com/rhops/ansible-static-include-demo/commit/1e277440f5aca6bb1d918ef24e15e82a242c7e52">example</a></li>
  <li><code>vars</code> section in playbook. <a href="https://github.com/rhops/ansible-static-include-demo/commit/594aca1ddef3f3e888588cd0990fa7fd97e0054b">example</a></li>
  <li>Files which will be included in the <code>vars_files</code> section of playbook. <a href="https://github.com/rhops/ansible-static-include-demo/commit/fa29542da30eb98ecf22c6b55d54ecddc1a867cb">example</a></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="handler-include">Handler Include</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_roles.html#dynamic-versus-static-includes">doc</a> points out that it is impossible to notify trigger handlers from dynamic includes. The correct usage of handler include would looks like this.</p>

<p>
<code>yaml
---
- include: "{{ codename }}.yml"
  static: yes
</code>
</p>

<p>The <code>static</code> option introduced in 2.1 deserves more explanation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before 2.0, all includes were static, there is no need to add the <code>static</code> option.</li>
  <li>In 2.0, all includes were considered as dynamic, the code will not works even the variables are defined following the rules described in previous section. No errors occurs but the handlers will never be triggered.</li>
  <li>After 2.0, since handler includes must be static, the <code>static</code> modifier has to be added because includes with filename variables are considered dynamic unless forced to be static. Of course, <code>task_includes_static</code> and <code>handler_includes_static</code> could be leveraged. IMHO, it is not a good idea to override the default behavior of Ansible unless you have to.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dynamic-include">Dynamic Include</h3>
<p>Dynamic include is relatively trivial because it is just a form of task which means it is possible to combine include and other complex control facilities such as for loop.</p>

<p>There are several differences between static and dynamic include.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The time to expand the tasks. Dynamically included tasks will not get expanded until the include task is reached.</li>
  <li>Play and handler includes must be static.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that except for the circumstances under which the includes must be static, the gap between the two is really tiny. If both forms are applicable, they should result in the same state. In other words, they are equivalent in that case. If anyone find an exception, please drop me a comment.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Filename variable substitution is applicable for both static and dynamic include.</li>
  <li>Play and handler includes must be static.</li>
  <li>Static and dynamic includes are equivalent if they are applicable at the same time.</li>
  <li>Ansible is not 100% stable so far, pay attention to the the change log of every releases.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Vagrant and Ansible are used to manage my development environment which is really wonderful. Recently, I have written a Ansible playbook which would reboot the VM during Vagrant provisioning. Check <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/ansible.html">here</a> to see how Vagrant works together with Ansible. Besides, there are tasks left which are expected to continue after the VM comes back. It is easy to find a solution in Ansible</p>

<!--more-->

<p>
```yaml
—
- name: reboot the system
  shell: sleep 2 &amp;&amp; shutdown -r now “Ansible updates triggered”
  async: 1
  poll: 0
  become: yes
  ignore_errors: true</p>

<ul>
  <li>name: waiting for server to come back
wait_for:
  port: “{{ ansible_ssh_port | default(22) }}”
  host: “{{ ansible_ssh_host | default(inventory_hostname) }}”
  state: started
  delay: 10
  timeout: 60
delegate_to: localhost
become: no
```
</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the standard way to reboot and wait for a host to come back through polling in Ansible. However, it doesn’t work as expected. Technically, it works with <a href="https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt">libvirt</a> provider but not the built-in <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/virtualbox/">VirtualBox</a> provider.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Output of Ansible shows that the <code>wait_for</code> task is successful</li>
  <li>SSH connection failure occurs in <code>wait_for</code> task’s following task</li>
  <li>VirtualBox UI tells that the VM is still booting when <code>wait_for</code> task is done</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="triage">Triage</h3>

<p>What makes me confused is that VirtualBox tells that VM is still booting but the <code>wait_for</code> module has finished successfully. Disclose SSH connection failure from following task means that the VM is not ready yet. It seems that something is wrong with <code>wait_for</code> module.</p>

<p>For the first try, the value of <code>delay</code> option of <code>wait_for</code> task was set to a longer time like <code>30</code> which means Ansible will block for 30 seconds before it starts to check if the host is back or not. Every task got executed successfully and VirtualBox UI showed that the VM had been up. Though every thing seems to be OK, the workaround didn’t make sense because that is not how <code>wait_for</code> module works. It is supposed to poll the status of the VM and wait until port 22 of the VM is ready. However, the result tell that <code>wait_for</code> module will return immediately whenever it start to check the status.</p>

<p>Next, enable <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/ansible_common.html#verbose">Ansible’s verbose mode in Vagrant</a>. From the output of <code>wait_for</code> module we can find</p>

<p><code>
{
   "changed":false,
   "elapsed":10,
   "invocation":{
      "module_args":{
         "connect_timeout":5,
         "delay":10,
         "exclude_hosts":null,
         "host":"127.0.0.1",
         "path":null,
         "port":2222,
         "search_regex":null,
         "state":"started",
         "timeout":60
      },
      "module_name":"wait_for"
   },
   "path":null,
   "port":2222,
   "search_regex":null,
   "state":"started"
}
</code></p>

<p>Wait, why are the values of host and port <code>127.0.0.1</code> and <code>2222</code>? Aren’t they supposed to be the ip of VM and 22? The output means that 2 of Ansible’s facts, <code>ansible_ssh_port</code> and <code>ansible_ssh_host</code>, are interpreted unexpectedly. If not specified, Ansible’s inventory file will be <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/ansible_intro.html#the-inventory-file">generated by Vagrant automatically</a>. The content of inventory file generated by Vagrant is</p>

<p>```
# Generated by Vagrant</p>

<p>VM_NAME ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_port=2222 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=VM_DIRECTORY/.vagrant/machines/VM_NAME/virtualbox/private_key
```</p>

<p>Because Vagrant use a <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/forwarded_ports.html">forwarded port</a> to create SSH connection in VirtualBox, the host will be <code>127.0.0.1</code> and the port is a <code>2222</code> other than 22.</p>

<p>So, can we instruct Vagrant to generate the inventory file with the VM’s own address and port 22 by <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1922">disabling port forwarding</a>? Unfortunately, NO! You can disable any port <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/474">except the forwarded SSH port in VirtualBox</a>. That is because Vagrant require a way to access and configure the VM through SSH and port forwarding is used with VirtualBox provider. The libvirt provider uses <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/private_network.html">private network</a> to provide the SSH connection so the playbook works well.</p>

<p>The reason why <code>wait_for</code> module is able to finish successfully is that the forwarded port will be created before the VM is ready. Every time <code>wait_for</code> module starts to check the VM, it finds that the port is ready. In fact, only the host’s port is ready but the guest’s port is not.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Since the root cause has been found, there are several ways to fix it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Provide a <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/ansible_common.html#inventory_path">customized inventory file to Vagrant</a>. This is not a good practice because we should let Vagrant to manage as much stuff as possible.</li>
  <li>Pass the VM’s address and port to the playbook. Not good enough since hardcoded parameters should be avoided.</li>
  <li>Use the <code>search_regex</code> option of <code>wait_for</code> module. With the option, <code>wait_for</code> module will not just check if the port is ready, it will also try to read some data from the port and search if it matches the <code>search_regex</code>. After setting the <code>search_regex</code> option to <code>OpenSSH</code>, every one is happy now.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some lessons</p>

<ul>
  <li>Networking is really the must-know knowledge for Vagrant users.</li>
  <li>Ansible’s verbose mode is informative and should be turned on when something is abnormal.</li>
  <li>Let Vagrant to manage the environment as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
